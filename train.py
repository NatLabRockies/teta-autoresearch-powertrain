    `dke_per_mile` is the specific kinetic-energy change across a link,
    (v_out^2 - v_in^2) / distance, using the neighbouring links' speeds as the
    entry/exit speeds. It is the acceleration term of the energy balance, which
    nothing in the instantaneous (speed, grade, length) triple can express.
    A trip begins and ends at rest, so the missing neighbour at each end is
    filled with a speed of 0 rather than imputed.

    `v_in` is that entry speed on its own. Regeneration recovers only part of
    the braking energy while acceleration costs more than the kinetic energy it
    buys, so a given `dke_per_mile` is not worth the same amount of energy at
    every entry speed, and the signed difference alone cannot say which.
